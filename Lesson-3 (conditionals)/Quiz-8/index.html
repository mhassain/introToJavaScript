    <h2>Lesson-3: Conditionals</h2>
    <pre>
      From the smallest of creatures to the largest of animals, inevitably every
      living, breathing thing must ingest other organisms to survive. This means
      that all animals will fall within one of the three consumer-based
      categories based on the types of food that they eat.
    </pre>
    <ul>
      <li>Animals that eat only plants are called herbivores</li>
      <li>Animals that eat only other animals are called carnivores</li>
      <li>Animals that eat both plants and animals are called omnivores</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
      Direction: Write a series of ternary statements that sets the variable
      category equal to:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>"herbivore" if an animal eats plants</li>
      <li>"carnivore" if an animal eats animals</li>
      <li>"omnivore" if an animal eats plants and animals</li>
      <li>undefined if an animal doesn't eat plants or animals</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      TIP: Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,
    </h4>
    <i
      >If eatsPlants equals true and eatsAnimals equals false, then herbivore
      should be printed to the console.
    </i>
    <script>
      var eatsAnimals = true;
      var eatsPlants = true;

      var category =
        eatsAnimals && eatsPlants
          ? "omnivore"
          : eatsPlants
          ? "herbivore"
          : eatsAnimals
          ? "carnivore"
          : "undefined";

      console.log(category);
    </script>
