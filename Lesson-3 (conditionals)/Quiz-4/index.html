    <h3>
      A murder mystery is a game typically played at parties wherein one of the
      partygoers is secretly, and unknowingly, playing a murderer, and the other
      attendees must determine who among them is the criminal.
    </h3>

    <h4>Here's what we know! In this murder mystery there are:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>four rooms:</b> the ballroom, gallery, billiards room, and dining
        room,
      </li>
      <li><b>four weapons:</b> poison, a trophy, a pool stick, and a knife,</li>
      <li>
        and <b>four suspects:</b> Mr. Parkes, Ms. Van Cleve, Mrs. Sparr, and Mr.
        Kalehoff.
      </li>

      <div>
        <p>
          We also know that each weapon corresponds to a particular room, so...
        </p>

        <li>the <b>poison</b> belongs to the <b>ballroom</b>,</li>

        <li>the <b>trophy</b> belongs to the ,<b>gallery</b></li>

        <li>the <b>pool stick</b> belongs to the <b>billiards room</b>,</li>
        <li>and the <b>knife</b> belongs to the <b>dining room.</b></li>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          And we know that each suspect was located in a specific room at the
          time of the murder.
        </p>

        <li><b>Mr. Parkes </b> was located in the <b>dining room.</b></li>
        <li><b>Ms. Van Cleve</b> was located in the <b>gallery.</b></li>
        <li><b>Mrs. Sparr </b> was located in the <b>billiards room.</b></li>
        <li><b>Mr. Kalehoff</b> was located in the <b>ballroom</b>.</li>
      </div>
      <p>
        <i
          >If room equals gallery and suspect equals Ms. Van Cleve, then <br />
          Ms. Van Cleve did it in the gallery with the trophy! should be printed
          to the console.</i
        >
      </p>
    </ul>
