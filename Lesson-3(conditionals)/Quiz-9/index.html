    <h2>Lesson-3: Conditionals</h2>
    h4 In 2015, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics conducted research to reveal
    how average salary is
    <ul>
      <li>no high school diploma earned an average of $25,636/year,</li>
      <li>a high school diploma earned an average of $35,256/year,</li>
      <li>an Associate's degree earned an average of $41,496/year,</li>
      <li>a Bachelor's degree earned an average of $59,124/year,</li>
      <li>a Master's degree earned an average of $69,732/year,</li>
      <li>a Professional degree earned an average of $89,960/year,</li>
      <li>and a Doctoral degree earned an average of $84,396/year.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Directions: Write a switch statement to set the average salary of a person
      based on their type of completed education.
    </h3>

    <h4>
      Tip: To print out the average salary with commas (i.e. 59,124), use the
      toLocaleString() method and pass it the locale "en-US". For example,
      salary.toLocaleString("en-US").
    </h4>

    <pre>
      If education equals "an Associate's degree", 
      then the string"In 2015, a person with an Associate's degree earned an average of $41,496/year." 
      should be printed to the console.</pre
