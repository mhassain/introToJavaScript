    <h2>Lesson-3: Conditionals</h2>

    <h3>
      <p>Directions</p>
      <p>
        Ice cream is one of the most versatile desserts on the planet because it
        can be done up so many different ways. Using logical operators, write a
        series of complex logical expressions that prints only if the following
        conditions are true:
      </p>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>if flavor is set to vanilla or chocolate and</li>
      <li>if vessel is set to cone or bowl and</li>
      <li>if toppings is set to sprinkles or peanuts</li>

      <p>Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,</p>
      <pre>
        If <b>flavor</b> equals <b>"chocolate"</b>, <b>vessel</b> equals <b>"cone"</b> and <b>toppings</b> equals <b>"sprinkles"</b>, then <br/>
        "I'd like two scoops of chocolate ice cream in a cone with sprinkles." </pre>
    </ul>

    <script>
      var flavor = "chocolate";
      var vessel = "cone";
      var toppings = "peanuts";

      if (
        (flavor === "vanilla" || flavor === "chocolate") &&
        (vessel === "cone" || vassel === "bowl") &&
        (toppings === "sprinkles" || toppings === "peanuts")
      ) {
        console.log(
          `I'd like to scoops of ${flavor} ice cream in a ${vessel} with ${toppings}. `
        );
      }
    </script>
  </body>
