    <p>
      NASA's countdown to launch includes checkpoints where NASA engineers
      complete certain technical tasks. During the final minute, NASA has 6
      tasks to complete:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Orbiter transfers from ground to internal power (T-50 seconds)</li>
      <li>
        Ground launch sequencer is go for auto sequence start (T-31 seconds)
      </li>
      <li>Activate launch pad sound suppression system (T-16 seconds)</li>
      <li>Activate main engine hydrogen burnoff system (T-10 seconds)</li>
      <li>Main engine start (T-6 seconds)</li>
      <li>Solid rocket booster ignition and liftoff! (T-0 seconds)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>Write a while loop that counts down from 60 seconds and:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If there's a task being completed, it prints out the task</li>
      <li>
        If there is no task being completed, it prints out the time as T-x
        seconds
      </li>
    </ul>

    <script>
      var time = 60;

      while (time >= 0) {
        var prefix = "T-" + time + " seconds";
        var countDown = "";

        countDown =
          time === 50
            ? "Orbiter transfers from ground to internal power"
            : time === 31
            ? "Ground launch sequencer is go for auto sequence start"
            : time === 16
            ? "Activate launch pad sound suppression system"
            : time === 10
            ? "Activate main engine hydrogen burnoff system"
            : time === 6
            ? "Main engine start"
            : time === 0
            ? "Solid rocket booster ignition and liftoff!"
            : prefix;
        console.log(countDown);
        time--;
      }
