    <h3>
      Theater seats often display a row and seat number to help theatergoers
      find their seats. If there are 26 rows (0 to 25) and 100 seats (0 to 99)
      in each row, write a nested for loop to print out all of the different
      seat combinations in the theater.
    </h3>
    Rulls:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Write a nested for loop to print out all of the different seat
        combinations in the theater.
      </li>
      <li>The first row-seat combination should be 0-0</li>
      <li>The last row-seat combination will be 25-99</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>output each row and seat number on a separate line</h4>
    <script>
      var row;
      var seat;

      for (row = 0; row <= 25; row++) {
        for (seat = 0; seat <= 99; seat++) {
          console.log(row + "-" + seat);
        }
      }
